# Permission Skills
Permission Skills Source-code
Permission Skills adds 61 skills to your server which greatly enhances the role playing experience. All skills can be allocated to players through a regular permissions plugin and can be customised to your hearts content. You can add the skills to a group of players or individual players to create unique guilds, races and factions or even add perks to players who donate.

# Skills
All skills require the ".active" extension to enable them, for example "pss.invisible.active". On top of this most skills are customisable with various extensions, for example "pss.maxhealth.active" & "pss.maxhealth.health.10" which would activate the maximum health a player can have to only 5 hearts (10 x half heart).
